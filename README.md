LongPathFix
===========

This utility adds long path (> MAX_PATH = 260 characters) support to existing Win32 applications.

Many Windows file APIs are limited to 260 characters unless you [prefix the path with "\\??\\"](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx#maxpath) (and then you cannot use relative paths, "..", etc.). This fix converts regular paths to \\??\\-style paths on the fly, in an attmept to add long path support to an arbitrary application.

Usage
=====

Simply run, depending on whether foobar.exe is a 32-bit or 64-bit executable:

`LongPathFix_x86.exe [foobar.exe] args to foobar`

or

`LongPathFix_x64.exe [foobar.exe] args to foobar`

Child processes of your app will also have the fix applied on them, as long as they are of the same 32/64-bit architecture as their parent.

Known limitations
=================

* Only a handful of APIs are converted.
* 64-bit applications executing 32-bit child processes and vice versa are not supported.

Motivation
==========

This utility was created to workaround [clang](http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20440) and [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61922) issues on Win32, but it might come in handy for other purposes.
